# %description devel
# Adaptived is a simple cause-and-effect daemon for the Linux operating system.  It
# is designed to allow a user to construct a series of rules to automate tasks.
# The adaptived C API allows for the creation of custom causes and effects.
# Rules can also be added and deleted at runtime.  Finally, adaptived settings,
# e.g. logging level, can be changed at runtime.
