.SH NAME
memoptimizer \- Memory optimizer daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft 3
memoptimizer [-dvhs] [-m max_gb] [-a level]
.SH DESCRIPTION
memoptimizer
daemon monitors the state of free memory on the system and optimizes
availability of free pages as much as possible.
.LP
memoptimizer monitors current state of free pages overall and free
pages of each order. Based upon current rate of free pages
consumption and memory fragmentation, it predicts if system is
likely to run out of memory or if memory will become severely
fragmented in near future. If so, it adjusts watermarks to force
memory reclamation if system is about to run out of memory. If
memory is precited to become severely fragmented, it triggers
compaction in the kernel. The goal is to avert memory shortage
and/or fragmentation by taking proactive measures. To arrive at this
prediction, memoptimizer samples free pages of each order on each
node periodically and fits a straight line using method of least
squares to these sample points. It also computes current reclamation
rate by monitoring 
.B /proc/vmstat.
The equation derived for best fit
line is used to compute when free memory exhaustion will occur
taking into account current reclamation rate. If this exhaustion is
imminent in near future, watermarks are adjusted to initiate
reclamation.

.SH OPTIONS
memoptimizer supports following optional command line arguments:
.TP
.B \-d
Debug mode. memoptimizer will not run as daemon in debug mode.
.TP
.B \-v
Enable verbose mode. Use multiple \-v options to increases verbosity level.
.TP
.B \-h
Show command line help
.TP
.B \-s
Simulate a run. Combined with \-v, this can be used to check what actions
memoptimizer will take if it were running for real. WARNING: This option
is of limited use since each action taken by memoptimizer for real affects
free memory state and hence future actions. Actions reported by this option
are useful only to understand memoptimizer behavior and will not correlate
necessarily with actions memoptimizer would have taken if it were running
for real.
.TP
.B \-m max_gb
Maximum amount of gap (in GB) allowed between low and high watermarks as
memoptimizer adjusts watermarks. This can be used to set a cap on high
watermark for the system.
.TP
.B \-a level
Aggressiveness level for optimizations. Supported levels are:

.nf
.in +4
1	Low: Sample memory stats at longer interval
	and make slow gradual adjustments to system

2	Normal: Sample memory stats at a normal level
	so as to not add siginificant system load and
	make adjustments at normal level

3	High: Sample memory stats more frequently and
	make frequent adjustments to system to maintain
	high number of free pages available
.in -4
.fi

.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
Following configuration options are available in the configuration file
(/etc/sysconfig/memoptimizer or /etc/default/memoptimizer):
.PP
\fBVERBOSE\fR (number)
.RS 4
Verbosity level (0-5), higher level results in more information being logged
.RE
.PP
\fBMAXGAP\fR (number)
.RS 4
Maximum amount of gap (in GB) allowed between low and high watermarks
.RE
.PP
\fBAGGRESSIVENESS\fR (number)
.RS 4
Aggressiveness level (1-3) for optimizations, higher numbers mean more
aggressive optimization
